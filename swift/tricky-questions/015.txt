Q.

Will this code compile and run without crashes?
If yes, what will be printed?
Will the compiler give any warnings?
Is anything wrong with it?
Can this code be improved?

let x: Int? = Int("100")
let y = Optional<Int>(1_000)
let z: Optional<Int> = Int("10_000")

print(x!)
print(y!)
print(z)

A.

Yes, it will compile and run fine.
100, 1000 and nil.
We would have a compile warning on last line.
We do force unwrapping, which can cause run-time crashes.
We can use optional bindings to avoid force unwraps, which will make the code safer without crashes in cases where a value is nil.
