Q.

How many errors are in this code?

protocol A {
    static func foo()
}

class ClassA: A {
    static func foo() {}
}

class ClassB: A {
    class func foo() {}
}

struct StructC: A {
    static func foo() {}
}

A.

There are no errors.

Protocols force us to use static keyword if we want to declare a class or static method.

When the protocol is implementing by a class, we can use either static or class keyword (in case we want to override that method inside subclasses).
When the protocol is implementing by a struct, we should always use use the static keyword (we cannot use class, because it is a keyword that is used in the context of classes and class inheritance).
