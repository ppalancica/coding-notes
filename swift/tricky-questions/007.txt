Q.

What will this code compile?

protocol Player {
    var name: String { get set }
    var score: Int { get }
    var nickname: String { get }

    static var numberOfPlayers: Int { get }
}

struct Person: Player {
    var name: String
    var score: Int
    var nickname: String {
        return "Coolio"
    }

    static var numberOfPlayers = 0
}

var p1 = Person(name: "Pavel", score: 100)
p1.score = 50

var p2: Player = Person(name: "Andrew", score: 100)
p2.score = 50


A.

No. There will be a a compile error on last line.
Although p2 is a Person struct variable, the compiler see p2 as of type Player, where score is declared readonly.
