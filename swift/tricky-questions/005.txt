Q.

What will this code print?

class A {}

class B: A {
    func foo() {
        print("B-foo()")
    }
}

let a = A()
let b = B()
let c = b as A

if c is B {
    print(c.foo())
}

A.

The print(c.foo()) line won't compile.
Although c is of type B and we would go inside the if statement at run-time, c is still seen as of type A at compile-time.
